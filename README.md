# AH170 Governance Framework

This repository contains a bilingual (Malay + English) reasoning & governance dataset
built from real-world business, finance, and decision-making scenarios.

The focus of this framework:

- decision guardrails (avoid risky / irrational choices)
- risk vs trade-off thinking
- stop-loss & fallback rules
- constraints awareness (cash, trust, legal, capacity)
- structured sequencing (0–72h → 7–14d → 30d actions)

## Why it matters

Modern LLMs are good at *answers*, but often weak at:

- handling conflicting constraints  
- defining clear decision rules  
- knowing **when to stop**, or **what to do if Plan A fails**

This dataset trains models to think with governance discipline
instead of “nice-sounding advice”.
